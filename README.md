RibotChallenge

riAPI challenge.

This requires no advanced set-up, other than importing into an IDE. No libraries, no additional stuff! The minimum SDK is ICS (level 14) with the target being JellyBean MR1 (level 17).

Limitations
------

Not a huge amount of problems - the main ones being:
- High API level required. This would be mitigated in a standard release by using the support library etc., but I didn't use that for simplicity and brevity
- One of the studio images doesn't properly report its orientation and so is the wrong way round. Again, this would be fixed in a standard release
